Reflection Matchers are a group of RSpec matcher classes and methods to test for proper associations between ActiveRecord::Base classes.

Say you're working on the archetypical blogging application. The following methods are available.
  Post.should have_many(:comments)
  Post.should have_many(:taggings).as(:taggable)
  Post.should have_many(:tags).through(:taggings)
  
  Comment.should belong_to(:post)
  
  Tag.should have_many(:taggings)
  Tag.should have_many(:tagged).through(:taggings)
  
  Tagging.should belong_to(:taggable).polymorphically
  
Some less common ones:

  Something.should have_one(:other_thing)
  Something.should have_one(:other_thing).through(:some_other_thing)
  Something.should have_and_belong_to_many(:other_things)
